## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0.0
- Node.js >= 14.x (for CDK applications)
- Docker

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure AWS credentials
3. Review environment-specific configurations
4. Follow module-specific setup instructions

## Common Operations

### Deployment
```bash
# Infrastructure deployment
cd terraform/modules
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Pipeline deployment
cd pipeline/cdk
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Monitoring
1. Access CloudWatch dashboards
2. Review Grafana metrics
3. Check alert configurations

### Cost Management
1. Review Cost Explorer reports
2. Check resource utilization
3. Implement optimization recommendations

## Best Practices

### Security
- Follow least privilege principle
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Implement encryption at rest and in transit

### Performance
- Monitor resource utilization
- Implement auto-scaling
- Use caching where appropriate
- Optimize database queries

### Reliability
- Implement redundancy
- Regular backup testing
- Automated failover testing
- Incident response planning
